any location on the in-app map and find the weather there instantly.

## Technology

UIKit <br />
API integration with OpenWeatherMap API <br />
Networking with URLSession <br />

## Functionality
ForeCasta allows users to simply press a location on the provided map to find what the weather forecast is there. 
ForeCasta also automatically finds the forecast based on the userâ€™s location, or the user can manually search for
